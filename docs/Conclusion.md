# Conclusion and Future Work :trophy:

Overall, this project was both rewarding and educational for our team, allowing each member to make meaningful contributions while expanding their technical and collaborative skills. Together, we implemented key features that were the building blocks of our infrastructure management system. Additionally, we designed a user interface that creates a cohesive and user-friendly experience across both administrative and user functionalities. 

Beyond feature implementation, our team took a comprehensive approach to testing. This was to ensure the reliability of each component. As a team we tackled various technical challenges, including formatting Firestore timestamps and dynamically updating HTML elements using JavaScript as well as testing with Jest and Playwright. These challenges required creative problem-solving strategies, allowing us to become more proficient in tools such as JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Firestore, Git, GitHub, Jest and Playwright. 

In future we hope to expand our platform to have push notifications, a heat map of campus to show a venues availability and photo uploads for maintenance requests to make the job of administrators easier. 

Throughout the project, clear communication and effective teamwork proved essential. Regular meetings in person and over Discord and consistent communication over WhatsApp kept us aligned, while collaborative practices, such as code reviews and task coordination, minimized potential conflicts and streamlined development. This experience allowed each team member to develop both technically and personally, reinforcing the value of collaboration, adaptability, and maintaining a high standard of work. 

Overall, this project significantly enhanced our technical capabilities in web development, introduced us to real-world team dynamics, and underscored the importance of collaboration in producing a polished, well-integrated product. The skills we gained will undoubtedly benefit us in future projects, both in team settings and independent work.
