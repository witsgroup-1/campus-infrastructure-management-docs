# Introduction :book:

The Classroom/Venue Management App is designed to enhance the efficiency of managing classroom and venue assignments, bookings, and maintenance on campus. This application integrates seamlessly with academic schedules, providing a centralized platform for room bookings, maintenance issue reporting, and schedule management.

Key features include a room booking system that allows users to reserve classrooms and venues for various purposes, a visual availability calendar for easy schedule viewing, and a notification system to keep users informed of upcoming bookings and updates. The app also supports an admin interface for managing schedules and maintenance tasks, ensuring that all aspects of campus venue management are handled efficiently.

While push notifications are a stretch goal, the appâ€™s secure and scalable infrastructure is built to ensure data integrity and availability. The user-friendly dashboard and robust APIs for booking, scheduling, maintenance, notifications, and user management together provide a comprehensive solution for optimizing space utilization on campus.
