# Testing and Quality Assurance :test_tube:

---

## Test Plan

- Jest was used to do testing.
- Tests will be made for functions after they are coded so we can test them before deployment.
- There will be unit tests and integration tests.
- The test coverage reports will be uploaded to CodeCov.

## Tests

### Maintenance Tests
### Unit tests for Maintenance
Two copies of the maintenance frontend where made so we could standerdise the urls to the local url and not work with the production url.
#### Testing Maintenance Reports
We were testing the Maintenance Request Form where we mocked the structure of the html and the fetch request. The test mimics the DOMContentLoaded and the general structure of the form. 
- Unit test 1: Submits the form correctly. -> Mocks the data and checks if the form has been posted via fetch request when the form is submitted.
- Unit test 2: Displays an alert if venue is not selected correctly. -> The test mocks the html data and creates a DOM content loaded event. We simulate an empty input for venues and we spy on an alert to see if it tells us to "Please select a valid venue from the dropdown". We expect the venue input field to be reset.

Overall 50% coverage of this file. It is not full coverage as the authentication is tested with other files and some of the integration tests actiually cover these smaller aspects of the code to do with the venue dropdown.
#### Testing Maintenance Logs
We were testing the different functions of the maintenance logs where we mocked the DOM methods, the fetch request and the input data.
- Unit test 1: Fetches maintenance requests and displays them -> it mocks the DOM and the fetch request then checks if the content is appended to our mocked UI.
- Unit test 2: Displays requests for desktop -> using mock data and one of the mocked UI elements, it check if it has displayed the data in the correct desktop format.
- Unit test 3: Displays initial request for mobile and handles Show More button -> using mock data and one of the mocked UI elements, it check if it has displayed the data in the correct mobile format and then checks if the show more click has worked and more data is displayed.
- Unit test 4: Creates request block -> tests that the function to create the test block with the correct value displayed like "Venue: Room 1" in the resulting html.
- Unit test 5: Opens popup with correct content -> tests that when opening the popup, the resulting html contains the correct input text.
- Unit test 6: Saves changes and updates request -> tests that the mocked fetch request for the post method is successful and that the popup becomes hidded after saving the changes that we posted.
- Unit test 7: Closes popup -> tests that the popup closes when we click close.
We are testing the staff users function works
- Unit test 1: Fetches staff members and populates dropdown when input is provided -> Fetches the staff members (those who arent lecturers, tutors and students) via a search of 'Jo' (our mock data). It poulates the dropdown and we verify this.
- Unit test 2: Clears and hides dropdown when no query is provided. So provide a empty query in the input field, start the event and expect a clear dropdown that is hidden.
- Unit test 3: Check if the code handles an API error gracefully for the staff search. -> Mock the failed API response, then check if the dropdown is hidded and cleared.
- Unit test 4: Handles staff selection from dropdown. -> So we call the setupStaffSearch(apiKey) function to set up the search. Then we populate the dropdown. We simulate the click of an option and then verify the input value is updated.

Overall 89% coverage of this file- the left our lines of coverage were not integral for testing.

### Integration Testing for Maintenance
Using playwright we did ingtegration testing as it would go into the browser and test the code from there.

#### Testing Maintenance Reports
Testing the dropdown integration:
- Get some mock data and test that the dropdown should populate the dropdown when the venue data loads. We expect to see the mock room names ro appear
- Check if a venue is selected, it updates the input field. So we populate the dropdown, mock the click and then we expect the input field to update with our choice.
- Clear the dropdown when  the clearVenueDropdown function is called. We populate the dropdown and see if it clears once we call the function.

### Testing for editBookings.js

## Overview

The test suite for editBookings.js focuses on validating the correctness of utility functions related to date formatting, time slot extraction, and validation of dates and time slots. The tests use the Jest framework to ensure these functions behave as expected under various scenarios.

## Test Descriptions

`formatDateDMY` Function:

Purpose: To verify that the formatDateDMY function correctly formats a given date string into the "Day Month Year" format.
Test Case: For the input date string '2024-09-17', the function should return '17 September 2024'.

`extractStartEndTime` Function:

Purpose: To ensure that the extractStartEndTime function accurately extracts and returns the start and end times from a time slot string.
Test Case: For the input time slot '9:00 AM - 11:00 AM', the function should return an object { startTime: '9:00 AM', endTime: '11:00 AM' }.

`isValidDate` Function:

Purpose: To check if the isValidDate function correctly identifies valid and invalid date strings.
Test Cases: The function should return true for the valid date string '2024-09-17' and false for an invalid date string 'Invalid Date'.

`isValidTimeSlot` Function:

Purpose: To verify that the isValidTimeSlot function correctly validates time slot strings based on the expected format.
Test Cases: The function should return true for the valid time slot string '9:00 AM - 11:00 AM' and false for an invalid time slot string 'Invalid Time Slot'.

## Setup and Teardown
Global Mock: fetch is mocked globally to prevent actual network requests during tests.
Reset State: Before each test, the mock for fetch is cleared, and any necessary global or DOM state is reset.
These tests ensure that the utility functions in editBookings.js perform their intended tasks accurately, contributing to the overall robustness of the application.

### Book Venue Testing

#### Unit Tests for `book-venue.js`

In this section, I created unit tests to verify the functionality of key functions in the `book-venue.js` file. The main goal is to ensure that the user data is fetched correctly, venues are rendered as expected, and the allowed categories for bookings are properly determined based on user roles. I used Jest for testing and mocked several dependencies, including Firebase and the global `fetch` function.

**Mocking Firebase and Global Dependencies**

Before diving into the individual tests, Firebase services and global functions like `fetch` and `alert` are mocked to isolate the code being tested:

- **Firebase Mocks:** Firebase is mocked to avoid actual API calls to Firebase's authentication and Firestore services during testing. This ensures that the tests focus on how the application handles Firebase-related data and functions.
  
- **Global Fetch Mock:** The `fetch` function is mocked to simulate API responses. This allows us to control whether the fetch request succeeds or fails, which is particularly useful for testing error handling.

- **Global Alert Mock:** `window.alert` is mocked to prevent actual alerts from popping up during tests, while still allowing us to verify that it was called.

**Test 1: `fetchUserData` Function**

The `fetchUserData` function is responsible for fetching user data from the API. The function should return user information if the API call is successful, or `null` if the user is not found (404 error).

- **First Test:** Verifies that `fetchUserData` correctly fetches and returns user data. The test mocks a successful API response with a sample user object and checks that `fetch` is called with the expected URL.
  
- **Second Test:** Simulates a 404 response from the API and verifies that `fetchUserData` returns `null` in this case.

**Test 2: `fetchAndRenderBookings` Function**

This function fetches available venues based on the userâ€™s role and renders them in the DOM. The test mocks the DOM elements necessary for rendering the venues and verifies that the function correctly fetches the appropriate venues based on the user's role.

- **Test:** The test checks that the function fetches venues with the correct category filter and renders them in the DOM. It ensures that the `fetch` function is called with the correct API URL.

**Test 3: `getAllowedCategories` Function**

The `getAllowedCategories` function determines which categories of venues the user is allowed to book, based on their role (e.g., Student, Tutor, Lecturer).

- **First Test:** Verifies that students who are not tutors or lecturers can only book study rooms. The test provides user data with the role of "Student" and checks that the function returns the correct allowed categories.

- **Second Test:** Verifies that staff members who are lecturers can book multiple categories of venues, including tutorial rooms, exam venues, boardrooms, and lecture halls.

**Test 4: `renderVenues` Function**

This function renders venue data into the DOM. The test ensures that venues are displayed correctly in the bookings container based on the user's role and privileges.

- **Test:** The test checks that the function correctly renders the venue names and details into the DOM. It mocks two venue objects (Lecture Hall and Tutorial Room) and verifies that both venues are displayed in the `bookingsContainer` element.

**Conclusion**

These unit tests ensure that key functions in `book-venue.js` are working correctly by simulating various scenarios, such as successful and failed API calls, different user roles, and venue rendering in the DOM. Mocking Firebase and global functions allows us to isolate the functionality of the code and focus on testing its logic without interacting with external services.

## Why is our code coverage ___%
### For Milestone 2 
We focused our attention on unit tests for the core features. 

Some lines of code are not covered as thouroughly: This is not a bad thing as some lines are not nessacary to cover or do not need to be as strongly covered as they are functions not prone to error/pointless in the grand scheme of the project.

Some functions have not been unit tested yet and some tests have not been integrated with the main repository.

Patch Coverage is sometimes higher then code coverage: This can often be better then high code coverage as it focuses on the changes to code introduced per pull, patch etc. So it checks how much of the new code is covered by tests and thus shows a good quality in the changes made and helps prevent the introduction of new issues such as regressions.
(ref: https://about.codecov.io/blog/why-patch-coverage-is-more-important-than-project-coverage/)

# Add Venues Page Unit Testing 

## Overview

The test suite for the addVenues page uses Jest to perform unit tests on the main functions in `addVenueCopy.js`. The tests cover the core functionality of fetching venues, displaying venues, creating venue blocks, adding new venues, and handling form submissions.

## Test Coverage

The current test coverage for this suite is 82.6%.

## Key Areas Tested

1. **API Interactions**: 
   - `fetchVenues()`: Tests successful API calls and error handling.
   - `addVenue()`: Verifies correct API calls for adding new venues.

2. **DOM Manipulations**:
   - `displayVenues()`: Ensures correct rendering of venue information.
   - `createVenueBlock()`: Checks the structure of individual venue blocks.

3. **Form Handling**:
   - `handleFormSubmit()`: Tests the form submission process, including successful submissions and error scenarios.

## Testing Approach

- **Mocking**: The global `fetch` function is mocked to simulate API calls without actually making network requests.
- **DOM Simulation**: A minimal HTML structure is set up before each test to simulate the necessary DOM elements.
- **Event Simulation**: Form submission events are simulated to test the `handleFormSubmit` function.

## Why Not 100% Coverage?

While 82.6% coverage is good, it's not 100% for several reasons:

1. **Error Scenarios**: Some error paths might not be fully covered, especially for network or unexpected errors.

2. **DOM Event Listeners**: The `initVenueManagement` function, which sets up event listeners, is likely not fully tested due to the complexity of simulating DOM content loading.

3. **Browser-Specific Functions**: Functions like `alert()` are mocked but their full behavior in a browser environment isn't tested.

4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Some edge cases in asynchronous operations might be missed.

5. **Environment Variables**: The `apiKey` constant isn't tested, as it's typically an environment variable.

# Integration Testing for addVenue Page

## Overview

This document outlines the integration tests for the addVenues Page using Playwright. These tests verify the end-to-end functionality of adding new venues and fetching existing venues.

## Test Suite

### 1. Add Venue and Verify List

This test case verifies the process of adding a new venue and confirms its presence in the venues list.

#### Steps:

1. Navigate to the Add Venue page.
2. Fill out the venue form with test data.
3. Submit the form.
4. Verify the success alert.
5. Check if the new venue appears in the updated venues list.

#### Assertions:

- Confirm the success alert message.
- Verify the presence of the newly added venue in the list.
- Check if all venue details (name, capacity, category, features, building) match the input data.

### 2. Fetch and Display Existing Venues

This test case ensures that existing venues are properly fetched and displayed on the page load.

#### Steps:

1. Navigate to the Add Venue page.
2. Wait for the venues list to load.
3. Extract the list of displayed venues.

#### Assertions:

- Verify that the venues list is not empty.
- Check the structure of each venue block, ensuring all required information is present.

## Test Environment

- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Browser**: Default browser provided by Playwright
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/adminDashboard/addVenue.html`

## Running the Tests

To run these tests:

1. Ensure the application is running on `localhost:3000`.
2. Execute the Playwright test command (e.g., `npx playwright test`).

## Notes
- The tests include a 1-second wait time after adding a venue to allow for list updates. This might need adjustment based on actual application performance.
